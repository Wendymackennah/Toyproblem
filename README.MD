## Week 1 Toy Problems
Welcome to Week 1 of the Toy Problems! In this set of challenges, you will be working on solving 3-4 problems using JavaScript. Before you start, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites:

## Instructions followed:
1. Create a repository on your GitHub account
Create a new repository on your GitHub account dedicated to Week 1 Toy Problems. This repository will be used to store all your solutions. Make sure to create a clean structure with a folder for each problem and 3-4 files for each solution. Remember, each solution should be in its own file.

2. Use JavaScript for the solutions
All solutions must be implemented in JavaScript. You can choose the version of JavaScript you are most comfortable with, whether it's ES5, ES6, or beyond.

3. Push the solution to the repository
After completing each problem, push the solution to your GitHub repository. This ensures that your progress is saved and can be reviewed later.

4. Submit the repository link for grading
Once you have completed all the challenges, submit the link to your GitHub repository for grading. This will be the link that will be used to assess your solutions.

5. Ensure your repository has a well-written README


## CHALLENGE 1 Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)

Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond the correct grade, as shown below: 

        A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

 ## Studentgradegenerator
This simple JavaScript program prompts the user to enter student marks and calculates the corresponding grade based on predefined grade ranges.

## How to Use
Open the HTML file containing the JavaScript code in a web browser.

When prompted, enter the student marks.

The program will calculate the grade and display it using an alert.

Grade Ranges
A: 79 - 100
B: 60 - 69
C: 49 - 59
D: 40 - 49
E: 40 and beloW



## Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)

Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

   > For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.
## Speed Detector
This program is designed to evaluate a car's speed and determine if the driver should receive demerit points based on the speed limit. It follows a simple logic:

If the speed is less than 70 km/s, it prints "Ok."
For every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70 km/s), the driver receives one demerit point, and the total number of demerit points is printed.
Additionally:

If the driver accumulates more than 12 demerit points, the program prints "License suspended."
## How to Use
Run the program.

Enter the speed of the car when prompted.

The program will evaluate the speed and provide feedback based on the rules mentioned above.
## Challenge 3 Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)

Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary. 

NB: Use KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the link below.

## NetSalarycalculator
Net Salary Calculator
This program is designed to calculate an individual's net salary based on the inputs of basic salary and benefits. It performs the following calculations:

Gross Salary: Sum of the basic salary and benefits.
Payee (Tax): Income tax deducted from the gross salary.
NHIF Deductions: Deductions for the National Hospital Insurance Fund.
NSSF Deductions: Deductions for the National Social Security Fund.
Net Salary: The remaining amount after deducting taxes and contributions.
## How to Use
Run the program.

Enter the basic salary and benefits when prompted.

The program will perform the necessary calculations and display the gross salary, payee, NHIF deductions, NSSF deductions, and net salary
